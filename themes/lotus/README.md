2. Set the `:sass-path` key in `content/config.edn` to where `sass` was installed. If it was installed globally, leave it as `"sass"`.
3. Change the `:theme` key in `content/config.edn` to `"lotus"`.
4. Replace the GitHub and LinkedIn links in `base.html` with links to your own profiles. (More social media icons can be found in `icons.svg`.)
